# Header Customizations

This document describes two customizations that have been made to the header section of a website. The changes were implemented using the `{header.liquid}` and `{main-menu-links.liquid}` snippet and the JavaScript file.

## Functionality 1: Scrolling Header and Logo Changes

The header and logo of the website change when the user scrolls. The changes are implemented using JavaScript and the `{header.liquid}` section. A video preview of the scrolling header and logo changes can be viewed here: [{https://gyazo.com/abfb60185d4e6ac91f47722b9157d330}](https://gyazo.com/abfb60185d4e6ac91f47722b9157d330).

## Functionality 2: Custom Pictures for Header Menu Links

Custom images have been added to the links in the website's header menu. These changes are implemented using JavaScript and the `{main-menu-links.liquid}` snippet. A video preview of the custom header menu images can be viewed here: [{https://gyazo.com/c55154bdcf5805cdb322afcd40c3e281}](https://gyazo.com/c55154bdcf5805cdb322afcd40c3e281).


## Note
The main CSS file is not included in this document. The JavaScript file contains a single class called "Header", which includes two methods: "toggleColor" and "showImage".
